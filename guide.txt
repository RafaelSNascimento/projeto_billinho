Notes:
i had change column telephone to bigint because int aceppts only 4 bytes, telephone number generally have more than 4 bytes.
i had change column gender to limit 1, because it will be 'M' or 'F'.
i had change column type name to is_type because type column name is reserved for storing the class in case of inheritance.
